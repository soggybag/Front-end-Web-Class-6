### 1 - Getting Started on your portfolio 

CSS Grid systems. Your best design, and most common layout will 
involve dividing a page into columns with widths in the following ratios:

- 100%
- 75%
- 66%
- 50%
- 33%
- 25%

With a little bit of planning you can write CSS rules to cover all of these.

Look at the examples here: [Grid](Grid)

### 2 - Work 

Work on your portfolio. 
Start by thinking about layout and planning the structure of your page. 
If you are having trouble getting started follow the sequence from class:

1. HTML - mark up your content
    - Use the appropriate tags
    - use div tags to block in columns
    - Add class names to elements
2. CSS - style your markup
    - Set the base font styles on the body tag
3. JavaScript - add interactive features with JS
