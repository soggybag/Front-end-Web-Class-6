### 1 - Getting Started on your portfolio 

CSS Grid systems. Your best design, and most common layout will 
involve dividing a page into columns with widths in the following ratios:

- 100%
- 75%
- 66%
- 50%
- 33%
- 25%

With a little bit of planning you can write CSS rules to cover all of these. 

### 2 - Work

If you are having trouble getting started follow the sequence from class:

1. HTML - mark up your content
